# DataRelease

## SH0ES-2022

May 19, 2022:
We are providing here "high level data products" for the full SH0ES+Panthon+ ladder.  The data is provided in the compact matrix form (linear equations) given in the paper, Riess et al. 2022, section 2.1 and equation 6, y=data vector, L=equation matrix (also includes some data), C=covariance matrix.  These are given as fits files.  Code is provided to load these and to run an MCMC.


Jan-2022: We are first making publicly available the new measurements of Cepheids in the optical and NIR as described in Riess et al. 2022 and Yuan et al. 2022
for the hosts of the original 19 SN Ia in Riess et al. (2016), NGC 4258 and the LMC which will allow one to do the style of analysis such as in Riess et al. (2016) with the pre-new release sample.  The expanded sample data and covariance matrix needed to use it will become available in the near term.  Please see details in those two papers which describe the new data and the various calibrations and improvements made over what was previously available.  As this is a new data release with real improvements, please use this instead of a prior data product.
